# vim-colors-github

A Vim colorscheme based on Github's syntax highlighting as of 2018.

I wasn't happy with [endel/vim-github-colorscheme](https://github.com/endel/vim-github-colorscheme), as it was out of date.

It degrades gracefully in non-gui mode (ie ctermbg/ctermfg/256colors).

It supports the following plugins:
[airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline),
[lightline](https://github.com/vim-airline/lightline),
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
[GitGutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter),
[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree),
[Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify),
[sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak),
and `:terminal`.

Extra tuning has been done for the following languages:
Vim script, Markdown, Pandoc Markdown 
([vim-pandoc-syntax](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax))
Diff, C, Rust,
Go ([fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)),
Haskell 
([neovimhaskell/haskell-vim](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/haskell-vim)),
Ruby, Python, HTML, XML, TOML, YAML, Clojure, Typescript,
([leafgarland/vim-typescript](https://github.com/leafgarland/vim-typescript)),
JSX/TSX 
([MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty](https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty)),. 


## Install

Install with your favourite plugin manager. For vim-plug:

```vim
Plug 'cormacrelf/vim-colors-github'
```

Then set your colorscheme to 'github':

```vim
" in your .vimrc or init.vim
colorscheme github

" if you use airline / lightline
let g:airline_theme = "github"
let g:lightline = { 'colorscheme': 'github' }
```

## Options

Place **before** the `colorscheme github`:

```vim
" use a slightly darker background, like GitHub inline code blocks
let g:github_colors_soft = 1

" use the dark theme
set background=dark

" more blocky diff markers in signcolumn (e.g. GitGutter)
let g:github_colors_block_diffmark = 0

:help github_colors.txt
```

### How to toggle background and also refresh the Lightline theme?

There is a built-in background toggler that does this. Make a mapping for it 
like so:

```vim
call github_colors#togglebg_map('<f5>')
```

### Italicize comments

If your terminal supports italics, place the line below **after** the
`colorscheme github`:

```vim
hi Comment gui=italic cterm=italic term=italic
```
